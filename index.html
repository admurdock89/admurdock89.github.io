    <h1>WELCOME TO SHARP START</h1>
    <h4>"Children will do valuable things when they feel valued"</h4>

    <h1>BELIEVING IN SHARP STARTS!</h1>
    <h2>Our Background</h2>
    <p>We are a small community organization located in the community of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. We are firm believers in
        the endless potential of all children and their unique abilities. Knowing first hand that a strong educational foundation
        is imperative to success, we started our mission with a simple question: "How can we contribute toward helping children
        in our community feel confident in themselves on the first day of school?" Although pencils and notebooks are essential
        to student success- we decided to approach our mission from a different angle. Sharp Start came to be shortly after
        seeing the smiles on our own children's faces after their school clothes and sneakers were purchased to start the
        2017 school year. It is a tradition that has come to be expected in our home of five children. New sneakers, new
        clothes, new backpacks for a new school year. Allowing for our wonderful, smart and talented children to feel confident,
        ready to learn and make new friends from day one. All we could hope for is the same for any other child. There are
        many very hard working and loving families in our community that all too often have to choose between life's wants
        and needs. What if there was a way for us to ease some of that burden? Sharp Start. Helping sharp kids get new gear
        for a new year. Each child we can reach through our referral service will receive a new backpack, a new pair of sneakers,
        and a first day of school outfit. For some families that means helping all three of their children to feel confident
        and ready to go on the first day of school. For some families it is simply the intimate relationship involved in
        receiving a little help privately- without having to stand in line publicly. As a thrifty shopper and mother of five,
        I personally enjoy purchasing these items for such deserving children! We operate solely on fundraising and donations-
        so the more help we get- the more kiddos we can help! We are currently in the process of partnering with Great Island
        Presbyterian Church for our non-profit status. We love investing in the future of our wonderful community. We love
        giving sharp kids a "sharp" start to a great year!</p>
